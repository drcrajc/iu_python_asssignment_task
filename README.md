Machine Learning Model Comparison and Evaluation
This project aims to compare the performance of various machine learning models on a dataset and select the best models based on their Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) values. The project uses several regression techniques, including linear regression, random forests, support vector regression, gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks.

Project Structure
ideal.csv: Contains ideal functions for comparison.
test.csv: Test dataset.
train.csv: Training dataset.
ssds_values.xlsx: Excel file to save SSD values.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
keras
matplotlib
openpyxl (for saving Excel files)
Installation
Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn keras matplotlib openpyxl

Usage
Load datasets: Load the training, test, and ideal datasets.

Prepare data: Prepare training and test data for model training and evaluation.

Define functions to fit models and calculate SSD:

fit_and_evaluate_model: Fits a given model on the training data and calculates SSD against ideal functions.
fit_and_evaluate_nn: Fits a neural network on the training data and calculates SSD against ideal functions.
Fit and evaluate models: Evaluate various models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR, Gradient Boosting, kNN, Neural Network) and calculate SSD for each ideal function.

Combine SSDs and models: Combine all SSDs and models into lists for comparison.

Save SSD values to an Excel file: Save the SSD values in an Excel file for later reference.

Print SSD values: Print the SSD values to the console.

Select the best models based on SSD: Choose the four models with the lowest SSD values.

Predict on test data: Use the selected models to predict values on the test dataset and calculate MSE.

Visualize results: Plot the test data and predictions to visualize the model performance.

Results
The SSD values for each model are saved in ssds_values.xlsx and printed to the console. The best four models based on SSD are chosen and used to predict the test data. The predictions and the test data are visualized and saved as test_predictions.png.
